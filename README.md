## üéØ What is this project?

<img width="1282" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ef61af5-9173-4ef6-abc4-406c8241bca4" />

This project is a simplified, open-source version of the popular **Linktree** service. It creates a single, customizable page that centralizes all your important links (social media, portfolio, projects, etc.) in one place.

Think of it as a **digital business card**. Instead of handing out multiple cards or sending several links to someone, you share just one. When they access it, they'll see an organized list of all your other links, making it easy to access everything you want to show.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Links Page:** Displays a list of buttons, where each one redirects to a different URL.

* **Admin Panel:** A simple, protected page at `/admin` to dynamically add and remove links.

* **JSON Storage:** Uses a `links.json` file as a simple "database," making the project lightweight and easy to manage.
* **Clean Front-end:** A minimalist and functional user interface that is easy to customize.
